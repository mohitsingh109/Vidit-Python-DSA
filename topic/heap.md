# Heap in Python

## Introduction to Heap
A **Heap** is a special Tree-based data structure that satisfies the **Heap Property**:  
- In a **Min-Heap**, the parent node is always smaller than or equal to its children.  
- In a **Max-Heap**, the parent node is always larger than or equal to its children.  

Heaps are widely used for **priority queues, scheduling, and streaming problems**.

## Common Operations on Heap (Python)
Python provides the **`heapq`** module for heaps. It implements a **Min-Heap** by default.

```python
import heapq

# Create a heap
heap = []
heapq.heappush(heap, 10)
heapq.heappush(heap, 5)
heapq.heappush(heap, 20)

print(heap)  # [5, 10, 20]

# Pop the smallest element
print(heapq.heappop(heap))  # 5

# Peek smallest (without popping)
print(heap[0])  # 10

# Convert list into a heap (in-place)
nums = [3, 1, 4, 2]
heapq.heapify(nums)
print(nums)  # [1, 2, 4, 3]

# Max-Heap (using negative values)
max_heap = []
heapq.heappush(max_heap, -10)
heapq.heappush(max_heap, -5)
print(-heapq.heappop(max_heap))  # 10
```
