# Tree Data Structure

---

## 1. Introduction to Trees

A **Tree** is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes.  
- Each node contains a **value** and **links to child nodes**.  
- The **root** is the top-most node.  
- **Leaf nodes** have no children.  
- A **binary tree** is a tree where each node has at most two children (`left`, `right`).

### Why Trees?
- Natural representation of hierarchical data (filesystems, org charts, XML/JSON).
- Widely used in databases, compilers, networking, AI, and search problems.

## 2. Common Operations on Trees

| Operation                          | Average Time | Worst Case | Space Complexity |
|------------------------------------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| Insert a node (BST)                | O(log n)     | O(n)       | O(1)             |
| Search for a node (BST)            | O(log n)     | O(n)       | O(1)             |
| Delete a node (BST)                | O(log n)     | O(n)       | O(1)             |
| Traversals (DFS: inorder, preorder, postorder) | O(n) | O(n) | O(h) recursion stack |
| Traversal (BFS: level order)       | O(n)         | O(n)       | O(n)             |
| Height of a tree                   | O(n)         | O(n)       | O(h)             |
| Check balance (AVL/Red-Black Trees)| O(log n)     | O(log n)   | O(1)             |
