# Set

## 1. Introduction to Set

In Python, a **set** is an unordered collection of unique elements.  
- It does not allow duplicate values.  
- Elements must be **hashable** (immutable types like int, str, tuple).  
- Commonly used for **membership tests**, removing duplicates, and set operations (union, intersection, difference).

Example:
```python
s = {1, 2, 3, 3}
print(s)  # {1, 2, 3}
print(2 in s)  # True
```

## 2. Common Operations on Set

| Operation | Average Time Complexity | Worst Case | Space Complexity |
|-----------|--------------------------|------------|------------------|
| Insert (add) | O(1) | O(n) | O(n) |
| Delete (remove/discard) | O(1) | O(n) | O(n) |
| Search (in) | O(1) | O(n) | O(1) |
| Union | O(len(s1) + len(s2)) | O(len(s1) * len(s2)) | O(n) |
| Intersection | O(min(len(s1), len(s2))) | O(len(s1) * len(s2)) | O(n) |
| Difference | O(len(s1)) | O(len(s1)) | O(n) |
